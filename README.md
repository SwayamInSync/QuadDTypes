# QuadDTypes: A Cross-Platform High-Precision Integer and Floating-Point Library
## Work In Progress... ðŸš§
`QuadDTypes` is a custom, cross-platform C++ template library that provides an implementation of both **128-bit integers (`Int128`)** and **quadruple-precision floating-point numbers (`Float128`)**. Designed for applications requiring high-precision numerical computations, this library offers a more accurate alternative to standard double-precision floating-point types (`double`).

### **Key Features**
- **128-bit Integer Support**: A custom implementation of 128-bit integers (`Int128`) that ensures cross-platform compatibility.
- **Quadruple Precision**: Implements `Float128`, a 128-bit floating-point type, offering far more precision than the usual 64-bit floating-point numbers.
- **Cross-Platform**: Developed to work seamlessly across different compilers and platforms, ensuring maximum portability.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Extendable**: Easily extendable for other types of high-precision calculations or specialized numeric types.
